⚠️ **SECURITY RISK REMOVED** ⚠️

The file `email_info.txt` contained plain text passwords and has been removed for security reasons.

All email configuration is now safely stored in `.env` file which should:
1. Never be committed to git (already in .gitignore)
2. Have restricted file permissions (600)
3. Be backed up securely

If you need the email credentials, check your `.env` file:
- `MAIL_PASSWORD` (for noreply@sertifikatet.no)
- `ADMIN_MAIL_PASSWORD` (for info@sertifikatet.no)

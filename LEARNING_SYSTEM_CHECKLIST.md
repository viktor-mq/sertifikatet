# üéì TikTok-Style Learning System Implementation Checklist

## üìã Project Overview - UPDATED INTEGRATION APPROACH
**Goal**: Integrate TikTok-style theory learning as an alternative learning method within the existing `/learning` section.

**INTEGRATION STRATEGY** (Updated 2025-01-08):
- **Single Learning Section**: Keep existing `/learning` URL structure
- **Dual Learning Modes**: 
  - Mode 1: Learning Paths (existing quiz-based system)
  - Mode 2: Theory Study (new TikTok-style modules with videos + content)
- **Unified Progress**: Cross-system progress tracking with smart completion recognition
- **User Choice**: Toggle between learning modes, option to mark categories as "known"
- **Minimal Disruption**: 95% of existing code unchanged, new features integrated alongside

**Timeline**: 4-week implementation (1 week per phase)
**URL Structure**: 
- Keep `/video` as-is
- Enhance existing `/learning` with theory mode
- New routes: `/learning/theory`, `/learning/theory/module/X`
**Video Format**: 9:16 vertical, 15-60 seconds per video, swipe navigation

## üîÑ INTEGRATION NOTES FOR AI MODELS

### **CRITICAL INTEGRATION CHANGES** (Updated 2025-01-08):

**DO NOT CREATE SEPARATE `/learn` SECTION!**

Instead:
1. **Enhance existing `/learning` section** with dual-mode functionality
2. **Add theory routes** as `/learning/theory/*` within existing blueprint
3. **Create mode toggle** in existing learning dashboard
4. **Build progress bridge** between Learning Paths and Theory Study
5. **Allow cross-system completion** (mark categories as "known")

### **Implementation Priority**:
1. Fix current blueprint to use `/learning` (not `/learn`)
2. Add theory mode routes to existing learning blueprint
3. Create progress integration service
4. Update existing dashboard with mode toggle
5. Build theory-specific templates as additional views

### **URL Structure** (CORRECTED):
- `/learning/` - Main dashboard with mode toggle
- `/learning/paths` - Learning Paths mode (existing)
- `/learning/theory` - Theory Study mode (new)
- `/learning/theory/module/1` - Theory module detail
- `/learning/theory/shorts/1.1` - TikTok player

**Key Principle**: Integration, not replacement. Both learning approaches coexist.

---

**Total Estimated Timeline: 4 weeks**
**Dependencies**: Video content creation, UI/UX design approval, performance testing

- [ ] Test `/quiz/session/{id}/submit` AJAX endpoint
- [ ] Test `/quiz/session/{id}/review` endpoint

## üéØ Feature Verification

### XP System
- [ ] **5-question perfect quiz**: Should award ~26 XP
  - Correct answers: 5 √ó 2 = 10 XP
  - Completion: 5 + (5 √ó 0.5) = 8 XP
  - Perfect bonus: 5 √ó 1.5 = 8 XP
- [ ] **20-question perfect quiz**: Should award ~85 XP
  - Correct answers: 20 √ó 2 = 40 XP
  - Completion: 5 + (20 √ó 0.5) = 15 XP
  - Perfect bonus: 20 √ó 1.5 = 30 XP

### Level Progression
- [ ] Level 1: 0-99 XP
- [ ] Level 2: 100-299 XP
- [ ] Level 3: 300-599 XP
- [ ] Level 4: 600-999 XP
- [ ] Level 5: 1000+ XP

### Modal System
- [ ] Celebration modal shows immediately after quiz
- [ ] XP counter animates from 0 to earned amount
- [ ] Circular progress ring animates
- [ ] Achievement unlocks show with proper animations
- [ ] Review modal opens with "Se gjennom svar" button

- [ ] Modals close properly (X button, ESC key, backdrop click)

### Real-time Updates
- [ ] Dashboard updates automatically after quiz completion
- [ ] Level badge updates when user levels up
- [ ] XP progress bar moves smoothly
- [ ] Achievement notifications appear
- [ ] No page refresh required

## üêõ Error Handling

### JavaScript Errors
- [ ] Check browser console for errors during quiz
- [ ] Verify graceful degradation if JavaScript fails
- [ ] Test with network disconnection during quiz
- [ ] Verify fallback behavior if modal system fails

### Database Errors
- [ ] Test behavior when XP rewards table is empty
- [ ] Verify fallback XP values are used
- [ ] Check error handling in gamification service
- [ ] Test rollback behavior on failed transactions

### API Failures
- [ ] Test quiz submission with API errors
- [ ] Verify user doesn't lose quiz progress
- [ ] Check error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Test retry mechanisms

## üîß Performance Tests

### Load Testing
- [ ] Test multiple simultaneous quiz submissions
- [ ] Verify XP calculations don't slow submission
- [ ] Check modal animations run at 60fps
- [ ] Test database performance with many users

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Test on Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Test on Firefox (latest)
